## Color Step Distribution Implementation Summary

### Implemented Features

#### 1. Dual Easing Curves for Light & Dark Ranges
- **Updated ColorToken type** to include:
  - `lightnessEasingLight` and `lightnessEasingDark` for independent lightness control
  - `saturationEasingLight` and `saturationEasingDark` for independent saturation control
  - `lightnessCompression` and `darknessCompression` for intuitive slider control
  - Custom curve properties for each range

- **Updated defaultColorToken** with recommended defaults:
  - `lightnessEasingLight: 'ease-out'` - Better perceptual spacing in light range
  - `lightnessEasingDark: 'ease-in'` - Better perceptual spacing in dark range
  - Both compression values default to 0

- **Enhanced DesignSystemContext** to handle all new properties in the reducer

- **Created generateDualEasedSteps function** in easingUtils.ts to apply different easing curves to light and dark ranges independently

- **Updated ColorControl component** to use dual easing curves when available, falling back to single curves for backward compatibility

#### 2. Perceptual Range Compression Sliders (Intuitive UI)
- **Added Simple/Advanced mode toggle** in ColorControlSidebar using Tabs component
  
- **Simple Mode Features:**
  - Light Step Compression slider (-100 to 100)
  - Dark Step Compression slider (-100 to 100)
  - Sliders automatically update the corresponding easing curves
  - Clear labels: "Expanded", "Linear", "Compressed"
  
- **Advanced Mode Features:**
  - Four separate EasingCurveEditor components:
    - Lightness Light Range
    - Lightness Dark Range
    - Saturation Light Range
    - Saturation Dark Range
  - Each with visual curve preview and dropdown selection

- **Created utility functions:**
  - `compressionToEasing()` - Maps compression values to appropriate easing curves
  - `compressionToBezier()` - Creates custom bezier curves for finer control

#### 3. Visual Step Distribution Graph
- **Created StepDistributionGraph component** that displays:
  - Line graph showing lightness values across all steps
  - Grid lines for easy reading
  - Primary step indicator with red color and dashed line
  - Hover tooltips showing exact lightness values
  - Responsive SVG that scales appropriately

- **Integrated into ColorControl component:**
  - Appears below color swatches when steps are shown
  - Updates in real-time as distribution settings change
  - Uses the same lightness calculation logic as the swatches

### Key Benefits

1. **Better Default Experience**: The new default easing curves (ease-out for light, ease-in for dark) create more perceptually uniform color scales out of the box.

2. **Intuitive Control**: The Simple mode with compression sliders provides an easy way to adjust color distribution without understanding bezier curves.

3. **Precise Control**: The Advanced mode allows designers to fine-tune each range independently with visual feedback.

4. **Visual Feedback**: The distribution graph makes it immediately clear how the color steps are distributed, helping designers make informed decisions.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: The system still supports the legacy single easing curve properties, ensuring existing designs continue to work.

### Usage Tips

- Start with the Simple mode compression sliders to quickly adjust step distribution
- Use positive compression values to cluster steps near the extremes (useful for UI surface colors)
- Use negative compression values to spread steps more evenly (useful for data visualization)
- Switch to Advanced mode for precise control when needed
- Watch the distribution graph to see the impact of your changes in real-time
