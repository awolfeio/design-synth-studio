### Plan for Richer Color Controls

The core idea is to move beyond editing single colors in isolation and provide tools that manage color relationships and perceptual qualities, which is how designers often think.

#### 1. Introduce Color Harmonies & Thematic Color Generation

*   **What it is:** Instead of relying on the user to pick multiple base colors manually, we can automatically generate harmonious color palettes based on a single primary color. This is a staple of professional color tools.
*   **How we'll do it:**
    *   Add a "Harmony" selector in the sidebar with options like `Complementary`, `Triadic`, `Analogous`, and `Split-Complementary`.
    *   Selecting a harmony will automatically create new color groups (e.g., `secondary`, `accent`) with their hues locked in relation to the primary color. For example, a complementary color's hue will be offset by 180 degrees from the primary.
    *   Changing the primary color's hue would then update all related colors in the theme, maintaining the harmony.

#### 2. Implement Perceptually Uniform Color Scales (LCH Color Space)

*   **What it is:** The current system uses HSL, which is intuitive but not perceptually uniform (e.g., a 10-point lightness change in a yellow looks different from a 10-point change in a blue). LCH (Lightness, Chroma, Hue) is a color space designed to match human perception, resulting in much more natural and aesthetically pleasing color scales.
*   **How we'll do it:**
    *   Add a color interpolation mode toggle to switch between `HSL` (the default mode) and `LCH`.
    *   When `LCH` is active, the color scale generation will happen in the LCH space. This means we'll interpolate Lightness and Chroma, which often produces smoother and more consistent gradients.
    *   This will require adding a color conversion library like `culori` to handle the math.

#### 3. Add Advanced Easing Curves for Lightness & Saturation

*   **What it is:** The current "Skew" sliders offer a linear bias. We can provide ultimate control by allowing designers to define a custom distribution curve for lightness and saturation across the color steps.
*   **How we'll do it:**
    *   Replace the "Skew Light/Dark Intensity" sliders with a visual "Easing Curve Editor".
    *   This editor will show a graph where the X-axis is the color steps and the Y-axis is the property value (e.g., lightness).
    *   Designers can then click to add points and drag them to create a custom curve (e.g., `ease-in-out`, or a curve with a specific dip or peak), giving them precise control over the rhythm of their color palette.

#### 4. Enhance Contrast Checking

*   **What it is:** The current WCAG check against black and white is great. We can make it even more useful by allowing checks against any other color in the design system.
*   **How we'll do it:**
    *   Next to the existing contrast ratio display on each color swatch, add a small eyedropper or a dropdown menu.
    *   This will allow a user to select any other color from their generated palettes as the comparison color, instantly seeing the contrast ratio between, for example, `primary-500` and `neutral-100`.

### Proposed Implementation Order

1.  **Enhanced Contrast Checking:** This is a direct and high-value improvement to an existing feature.
2.  **Color Harmonies:** This introduces a powerful, workflow-changing concept for theme creation.
3.  **LCH Color Space:** This is a significant "under-the-hood" enhancement that will noticeably improve the quality of the generated palettes.
4.  **Advanced Easing Curves:** This is the most complex feature to implement but offers the highest degree of fine-tuned control.
